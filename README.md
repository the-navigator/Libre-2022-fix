# âš™ LibrÄ“ Engine - A Brief Description
LibrÄ“  Engine utilizes a class application that turns it into a Dynamic Link Library(.dll). DLLs are used to store codes and commands that can be used by multiple applications in multiple instances. This engine is responsible for individual modularization of commands, reusability, and memory efficiency. Instead of relying on one single application for every task; the developers are now free to modify a separate project file for the execution of Commands to communicate with the database.

#  ðŸ›  Visual Studio Code Development Process of the team
As our team is not that expert in coding, we are constantly looking for ways to speed up our process. We use Visual Studio Code to write down the system for this and installed using the nuget-package-manager the SQLite Library to support this project.
